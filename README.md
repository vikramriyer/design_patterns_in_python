# Implementing Design Patterns in Python

## What are design patterns?
- Solutions to recurring problems in software.

## Index
1. [Creational](https://github.com/vikramriyer/design_patterns_in_python/patterns/creational)
2. [Structural](https://github.com/vikramriyer/design_patterns_in_python/patterns/structural)
3. [Behavioural](https://github.com/vikramriyer/design_patterns_in_python/patterns/behavioral)

## Types of Design Patterns
### 1. Creational
- Deal with object creation mechanisms
- So, we are able to create different instances of objects with different configurations; of the same class
ex: Polymorphism

### 2. Structural
- Deals with relationships between entities in software
- There are functional and non-functional requirements/goals in software and the goals yeild different Structural patterns
ex: Inheritance

### 3. Behavioral
- Deal with how the entities interact with each other
- What kind of protocols are set so that these entities interact better with each other
ex: Methods and their definitions

## Repository Structure
1. Code for all the patterns (creational, structural, behavioral) can be found 
in the `patterns` directory named after their type.
    - creational
    - structural
    - behavioral
2. Each of above directories has a file named `READ_THIS_FIRST.md`. Make sure to 
go through it first to understand the theory + analogy.

Finally, if you think the examples and code have helped you, do cite me. :)
