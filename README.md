# Implementing Design Patterns in Python

I am very thankful to [Sakis Kasampalis](https://github.com/faif) for his 
exceptional [repo](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) that gives a first 
hand look at using Design Patterns in Python. 
I follow a similar structure/approach as provided by him with more of a real 
world examples that might be helpful to some intermediate/advanced level devs.

Below are the types of Base Patterns as Copied from GOF(Gang of Four) 
design patterns book. 
There are quite a few patterns that are used repeatedly in a lot of 
applications and I will be updating them as and when I get time. :)

When time permits I will also try to rank a few instead of all of them that 
are most useful so that users will be able to understand which ones to learn 
first and come back later when some advanced stuff is required.

Here are some important tips:
1. Since the examples are real world examples based, there is a chance one 
might avoid looking at the code. The code snippets are actually very 
straight forward and there is no trickery involved.
2. I have found it helpful to always think the business use case first and then
extend the thinking in to technical depths.
3. The most important part to note is that there is always some analogous
example for a concept that you study. So, when revising a concept, going back
to the analogies is the best way I think.


If you happen to use it anywhere and found it helpful, do refer me somewhere 
in the post or copy my links from below. You can also follow me on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/vikramriyer). 
I try my best to update there as well.

1. Structural
2. Creational
    - Abstract Factory
3. Behavioural

Finally, the best way to learn design patterns is to code them yourself 
for the applications that you are building.
