# Implementing Design Patterns in Python

I am very thankful to [Sakis Kasampalis](https://github.com/faif) for his 
exceptional [repo](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns) that gives a first 
hand look at using Design Patterns in Python. 
I follow a similar structure/approach as provided by him with more of a real 
world examples that might be helpful to some intermediate/advanced level devs.

Structure of the Repository and how to get the most out of it
1. Make sure to check each of the base patterns (Structural, Behavioural, 
Creational) in patterns directory.
2. Each of the pattern is put inside a directory inside of patterns directory
with the name of the directory being the pattern name <br>
ex 1: patterns/creational/abstract_factory
ex 2: patterns/creational/xyz_pattern
3. each of these directories has a file named READ_THIS_FIRST.md. Make sure to 
go through the this markdown (.md) file first to understand the simple theory
that has real world (non-code based) analogies to make it easier for you to understand. Once 
you have got that, go and check the .py file that has the code.
4. Another awesome thing you can do is to come with a real world (code based)
example and try to code it up. You can also fork the project and raise a 
request. If your example is better than mine, I would more than happy to 
replace mine with your implementation with obvious credits to you in the .md
file and the main README.md file :)

Below are the types of Base Patterns as Copied from GOF(Gang of Four) 
design patterns book. 
There are quite a few patterns that are used repeatedly in a lot of 
applications and I will be updating them as and when I get time. :)

When time permits I will also try to rank a few instead of all of them that 
are most useful so that users will be able to understand which ones to learn 
first and come back later when some advanced stuff is required.

Here are some important tips:
1. Since the examples are real world examples based, there is a chance one 
might avoid looking at the code. The code snippets are actually very 
straight forward and there is no trickery involved.
2. I have found it helpful to always think the business use case first and then
extend the thinking in to technical depths.
3. The most important part to note is that there is always some analogous
example for a concept that you study. So, when revising a concept, going back
to the analogies is the best way I think.


If you happen to use it anywhere and found it helpful, do refer me somewhere 
in the post or copy my links from below. You can also follow me on 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/vikramriyer). 
I try my best to update there as well.

1. Structural
2. Creational
    - Abstract Factory
3. Behavioural

Finally, the best way to learn design patterns is to code them yourself 
for the applications that you are building.
